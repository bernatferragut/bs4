# bs4
bs4 + css3 + js => goes minimal

We set up a local environment similar to the Codepen Online for fast protoryping

1. Going minimal with a CDN =>  Outsourcing the location of files instead of having them locally
2. No Task Runner =>  We work only CSS (no SASS and others)
3. No Automatic Hot Reload => 
4. Manual Hot Reload => SHIFT + CMD + R on Mac ;)

> Easy and fast so we can focus on HTML + CSS + Javascript instead of putting a wall of tooling between us.
